## Vibe: Flow/Agentic Autonomy

## Last Verified: 2026-02-15 08:05

## Key Facts:
*   **Agentic Core:** Features "Cascade," the first AI-native agent system designed for multi-step, autonomous code edits.
*   **MCP Integration:** Heavily leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect to external systems (GitHub, Linear, Figma, Databases) through stdio/SSE.
*   **Codebase Awareness:** Uses a "Wave" update system (latest Wave 8) to maintain "Memories" across sessions, reducing context-switching.
*   **Interaction Modes:** "Flow" technology enables seamless transitions between high-level planning and surgical code changes.
*   **Infrastructure:** Built on top of VS Code, utilizing Codeium's proprietary AI backend for low-latency completions and agentic reasoning.

## Benchmarks:
*   **Accuracy:** Benchmark tests show a 30-40% increase in suggestion accuracy for complex, multi-file codebases compared to leading rivals.
*   **Efficiency:** Reported 3x faster feature development for users leveraging MCP integrations with project tracking tools (e.g., Linear).
*   **Latency:** Optimized for sub-100ms completions with specialized inference endpoints and edge caching.
*   **Platform Sync:** High compatibility with OpenClaw/Forge Labs via its extensible MCP layer.

## Score Snapshot:
*   Reasoning: 5/5 (Strong planning/execution loop)
*   Autonomy: 5/5 (Cascade's multi-step autonomy is a leader)
*   Speed: 5/5 (Fast indexing and nearly instant plan execution)
*   Context Handling: 4/5 (Relies heavily on MCP for external context)
*   Developer Experience (DX): 4/5 (Clean "Flow" state, but requires MCP setup for max power)
