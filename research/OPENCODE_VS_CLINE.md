# OpenCode vs. Cline (2026 Comparison)

## The "Sovereign Elite" Duel

### 1. Philosophy
*   **OpenCode.ai**: "The Personal Forge." Designed for developers who want to write their own MCPs and scripts.
*   **Cline**: "The Transparent Agent." Optimized for visual persistence (Memory Bank) and parallelism within VS Code.

### 2. Strategic Verdict
Since the future is **Self-Optimizing Tooling**, OpenCode.ai is the recommended choice for "Architect-Coders" who intend to build their own agentic infrastructure.

### 3. Comparison Table
| Feature | OpenCode.ai | Cline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customizability** | 5/5 (Agent forking) | 3/5 (Standardized) |
| **Context Retention** | 4/5 (Subagents) | 5/5 (Memory Bank) |
| **Backgrounding** | Elite (PTY) | Moderate |
| **Learning Curve** | High (Architect mindset) | Low (Visual UI) |
