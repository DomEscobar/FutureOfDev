# Cursor Research

## Vibe: Autonomous Development Hub / Frontier Power

## Last Verified: 2026-02-15 09:10

## Key Facts:
*   **Architecture (Cursor 2.0):** Landmark shift from a "chat-in-IDE" to a **multi-agent parallel interface**. Supports up to **8 parallel AI agents** running in separate git worktrees or remote environments.
*   **Proprietary Intelligence:** Debuted "Composer," Anysphere's first **proprietary coding model**, claimed to be 4x faster and more context-efficient than general-purpose LLMs for software builds.
*   **Agentic Loops:** Incorporates native browser testing and sandboxed terminals, allowing agents to verify their own code before presentation.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Enterprise tier offers **Zero-Retention** and dedicated VPC deployments. Privacy Mode uses ephemeral containers for processing code chunks.
*   **Telemetry Control:** Standard data collection can be restricted in Enterprise; however, the "home-calling" for model entitlement remains a core part of the binary.
*   **Monetization Engine:** High value-density. While it costs $20/mo, the "Composer" model provides significantly more tokens-per-dollar due to proprietary optimization compared to rivals using raw frontier APIs.
*   **License:** **Proprietary.** Owned by Anysphere. Not Forkable. While it uses VS Code as a shell, the core AI orchestration layer is strictly closed-source.
*   **Sustainability & Longevity:** **Extreme.** Tripled valuation in 6 months to **$29.3 Billion** (Nov 2025). Massive $2.3B Series D funding led by Accel, Nvidia, and Google. ARR surpassed $500M in mid-2025.
*   **Partnerships:** Backed by Nvidia and Google; deep alignment with frontier model releases (often first to integrate new Claude/GPT variants).
*   **Flexibility:** High IDE performance, but increasingly **monolithic**. To get the full 2.0 multi-agent power, you must use the Cursor fork; extensions for other IDEs lag behind in agentic features.
*   **Model Arbitrage:** **High.** Supports GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and proprietary Composer model.

## Benchmarks:
*   **Productivity:** Users report 2x to 3x faster feature development cycles using parallel agents vs. single-agent chat.
*   **Latency:** Sub-100ms ghost text. Composer model optimized for <2s first-token response on complex multi-file edits.
*   **Sourced Proofs:**
