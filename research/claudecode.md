# Claude Code Research

## Vibe: Terminal Mastery / Pure Reasoning

## Last Verified: 2026-02-15 08:25

## Key Facts:
*   **Architecture:** Agentic CLI tool built by Anthropic; designed for deep integration with local filesystems and terminal environments.
*   **Core Engine:** Utilizes Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet (and Opus 4.1/4.5 in 2026) for high-reasoning tasks. Features 128K output token capacity (Claude 3.7+).
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Proprietary enterprise-grade data protection; zero-retention options available via Anthropic Console settings.
*   **Telemetry Control:** Standard telemetry included, but highly restricted in enterprise deployments. Not designed for fully air-gapped use without API access.
*   **Monetization Engine:** Credits/Usage-based via Anthropic API; higher token/credit efficiency in complex reasoning compared to web apps.
*   **License:** Proprietary. Anthropic has demonstrated strict enforcement against reverse-engineering (takedowns issued in 2025). **Not Forkable.**
*   **Sustainability & Longevity:** Backed directly by Anthropic (billions in funding). Positioned as a core pillar of their developer ecosystem.
*   **Partnerships:** Native integration into major CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.) and supported by AWS Bedrock for enterprise scaling.
*   **Ecosystem Openness:** High support for MCP (Model Context Protocol). Allows connecting to external tools like databases and design APIs.
*   **Model Arbitrage:** **Low.** Hard-locked to the Claude model family. No support for third-party LLMs.

## Benchmarks:
*   **Performance:** 80.9% on SWE-bench (Verified) as of early 2026, leading among agentic coding tools.
*   **Speed:** Latency for reasoning is higher than autocomplete, but 30-hour autonomy capability allows for massive background tasks.
*   **Scalability:** High. Supports sub-agents and remote execution for large-scale enterprise repos.

## Score Snapshot:
*   Longevity/Sustainability: 5/5
*   Flexibility: 3/5 (CLI-only, no native GUI/IDE version)
*   Openness/Ecosystem: 4/5 (MCP leader, but proprietary/unforkable)
*   Reasoning: 5/5
*   Autonomy: 5/5
*   Speed: 4/5
*   Context Handling: 4/5
*   Developer Experience (DX): 3/5 (Terminal mastery required)
