  "description": "The current Item API leaks internal database IDs in URLs (e.g., /api/items/1). This allows for easy scraping. Implement a secure HashID implementation for all outbound URLs. The Red Test must prove that a raw integer ID fails to resolve on the new secure endpoints.",
  "expected_behavior": "IDs in URLs are obfuscated (e.g., /api/items/aB3x9z). Original integer IDs remain in the internal DB schema.",
