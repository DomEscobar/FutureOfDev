  "name": "REFACTOR: Decouple Item Storage from Server",
  "description": "The Item list is currently stored as a global slice in server.go. Refactor this into a dedicated data store package. Prove the decoupling with a test that can initialize the store without starting the Gin server.",
  "expected_behavior": "Item storage logic is moved to backend/internal/store/ and can be tested in isolation. server.go only handles routing.",
  "requirements": {
    "backend": true,
    "frontend": false
