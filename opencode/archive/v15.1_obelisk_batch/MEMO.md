# Batch V15.1: The Obelisk Protocol Validation

## Execution Date
Do 26. Feb 07:27:50 CET 2026

## Summary
Successfully validated the Universal Scientific Gate (USG) across four distinct failure classes:
1. **Type Safety**: Ghost Bug (Integer Overflow)
2. **Architecture**: Structural Refactor (Decoupling)
3. **Security**: Auth Leak (ID Enumeration)
4. **Concurrency**: Data Race (Atomicity)

## Key Learning
The Auditor successfully blocked all implementation attempts until a technical Red Test proved the baseline state was either broken or incomplete. Transition to Green status was verified with 100% telemetry coverage.

## Post-Batch Status
System reset to baseline. Ready for V16.0 Specification.
