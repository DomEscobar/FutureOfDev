{"verdict":"approved","summary":"AddCardButton component implementation approved. Component (67 lines) properly toggles between collapsed button and inline form states with correct TypeScript typing. Tests (157 lines) provide comprehensive coverage including initial state, form submission, whitespace trimming, cancel behavior, and multiple instances with proper Zustand store mocking. CSS styles (Board.css lines 1338-1460) are complete with hover/focus/active states, smooth transitions, and gradient submit button. Integration with boardStore is correct using the addCard action. No critical issues found - implementation is production-ready."}
