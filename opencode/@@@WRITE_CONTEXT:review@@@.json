{"verdict":"approved","summary":"Fixed Task model mock setup in taskController.test.js. The root cause of 'TypeError: require(...) is not a function' was that the mock was not properly exported as a constructor function. The fix ensures Task is exported as a function with chainable Sequelize methods (findAll, findByPk, create, update, destroy). Used jest.mock() to properly intercept the models module import, and ensured the mock returns a constructor that can be called. The test file now properly mocks the Task and Column models with the correct export pattern to match the controller's 'const { Task } = require('../models')' import."}
