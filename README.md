# FutureOfDev Research Matrix

Research‑first analysis of AI code assistants. No micro‑task battles; instead: capability matrices, forensic dossiers, sustainability forecasts.

**Core idea**: Evaluate tools across research‑grade dimensions (Context, Extensibility, Multi‑Provider, Platform, Lock‑in, Sustainability, Cost) with weights. Composite scores yield the ranking.

**Status**: Dossiers for top tools complete; matrix computed; forecasts drafted.

**Note**: The micro‑task harness and `runs/` have been removed to maintain research purity.
