# Continue Dossier — AI Code Assistant (Feb 2026)

**Repo**: `continuedev/continue`  
**License**: MIT  
**Stars**: ~16k (estimate) | **Issues**: high churn observed

## Capability Scores (0–1)

- Context Awareness: 0.90 (good project indexing, but some instability)
- Extensibility: 0.95 (fully open-source; `.prompt` customization; MCP support)
- Multi‑Provider: 0.95 (swap LLMs at will; local, API, cloud)
- Platform: 0.95 (VS Code, Cursor, Neovim, JetBrains via plugin)
- Ecosystem Lock‑in: 0.95 (minimal lock-in; runs anywhere)
- Sustainability: 0.92 (large community but recent build failures; monetization “Mission Control” concerns)
- Cost Efficiency: 0.95 (free; pay only for API costs)

## Forensic Notes

- High experimental churn; failing main branch builds (Feb 2026)
- Shift toward gated “Hub” monetization causing community friction
- Reddit reports: stability issues on LocalLLaMA

## Verdict

If core stabilizes, remains the go-to for maximum flexibility and zero vendor lock-in.
