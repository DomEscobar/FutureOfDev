# AI Code Battles: Final Assessment & Outcomes (v1.0)

## THE SOVEREIGN LEADERBOARD
1. **OpenCode (@anomalyco)**: **0.912** (Winner)
2. **Continue**: **0.836**
3. **Aider**: **0.765**
4. **Roo Code**: **0.721**
5. **Cursor**: **0.662**
6. **Claude Code**: **0.539**

## CRITICAL PERFORMANCE VECTORS
- **Resilience**: Aider/OpenCode lead. They can be forked if the maintainers disappear.
- **Portability**: Continue leads. It is the only tool bridging VS Code, JetBrains, and CLI simultaneously.
- **Velocity**: OpenCode leads. Anomaly's TUI-first approach is built for the fastest possible engineering loops.
- **Risk**: Claude Code/Copilot carry extreme "Platform Risk."

## WORKFORCE DEPLOYMENT VERDICT (1k+)
Target **OpenCode** for the primary CLI fork. Step-by-step "Zen-strip" execution is required to decouple from Anomaly's proprietary gateway before mass rollout.
