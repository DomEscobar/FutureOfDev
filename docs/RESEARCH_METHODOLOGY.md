# Research Methodology: Camoufox Deep-Dive 

## Protocol
- **Bypass**: Hardened browser to evade rate limits.
- **Forensics**: Analyzed `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and active branch density.
- **Swarm Audit**: Evaluation of Multi-Agent Orchestration (Handover fidelity, Parallel execution).

## Strategic Values
- Sustainability: Commit/Contributor velocity.
- Longevity: Governance risk.
- Forkability: Licensing purity.
- Swarm Capability: Native support for task delegation and recursive self-healing.
