# Testing Standards

- Use descriptive test names (Expected Behavior when Given Input).
- **Self-Healing Pattern:** If a test fails due to a selector change, analyze the DOM/source and propose a fix.
- Always include "Happy Path" and "Edge Case" scenarios.
- Output test results clearly in the terminal or chat.
