# Research & Discovery Protocol

- Use `@Web` or `@Docs` to gather external information.
- Always create a `PLAN.md` or `RESEARCH.md` before starting implementation.
- Focus on "Interface First" development—define types and contracts before logic.
- Verify findings across at least two independent sources when possible.
